| **Multithreading**              | A technique that allows multiple threads to exist within a single process, sharing resources but executing independently. | Operating systems, high-performance computing, and applications requiring parallel processing. | Improves application performance by allowing multiple operations to run concurrently.                           | A video editing software uses multithreading to process different parts of a video simultaneously for faster rendering.|
| **Network Protocol**            | A set of rules that defines how data is transmitted and received over a network.                      | Networking, internet communication (e.g., HTTP, TCP/IP, FTP).                  | Ensures reliable, secure, and standardized communication between devices over a network.                         | A web browser uses the HTTP protocol to request and receive web pages from a server.                            |
| **Node.js**                     | A JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side scripting using JavaScript.                 | Backend web development, real-time applications, and APIs.                     | Enables the use of JavaScript for server-side programming, allowing for full-stack JavaScript development.        | A developer uses Node.js to build a real-time chat application that runs on both the client and server sides.  |
